        If you are leading or coordinating a team, you should present the team performance model at the beginning of every project. One of the performance models was developed by Allan Dexter, and it illustrates seven different stages that participants in a project typically go through. After the project has started, follow up to your team members regularly:

        1. How far along are you? (at which stage of the project?)
      </TextBase>
      <TextBase textStyle="project-descr" lineHeight="2" p=".5rem 0">
        2. What do you need to do move forward (to reach the next stage)?
      </TextBase>
      <TextBase textStyle="project-descr" lineHeight="2" p=".5rem 0">
        If you are unsure about the work process, ask and write down the main keys that applies to each member individually and then summarize it as for the team. Groups move forward when one of its members takes the next step. As a leader, be prepared to be the first to make mistakes.

        Use the following questionaire simulating conversation with manager to get most honest feedback and then ask AI to analyze which stages are resolved or unresolved in the group from the project that is being carried out. It will help participants identifying the main challenges and strengths in their approach to the teamwork.
