        Another factor on making faster decisions is limiting the options to choose from. Because the more options you will juggle in your mind, the more dissatisfied you will be. Intuitively you might think that more variety will guarantee to make better decisions. but usually the opposite is true: the greater the choice, the higher our expectations- and the more we worry that we are going to make the worng choice, the most likely it will happen. Test how this paradox reflects in the real world situations. Watch the interview with Sintija about how it affects the most successful risk-takers.</TextBase>
