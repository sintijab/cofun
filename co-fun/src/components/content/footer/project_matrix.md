# Project planning phase
Classifying the projects according to the portfolio matrix including costs and time.

Accept only those projects if there is anything to learn from them and they correspond to your overriding vision.
Engage into only in those initiatives which moves towards achieving your objectives and shares your vision.

## The feedback analysis

Most people think they know what they're good at, but they're usually wrong.

Try new strategies to evaluate your and other's work.

Whenever you have an important decision to make, write down what you might expect to happen. After some time compare the outcomes with your expectations and whuch decisions had most of the impact on your actual plan.

Practice to give yourself a feedback and over the time recognize where and what kind of improvements are needed. In this way you can work out what your strengths lays and where they don't.

Write down feedback about other's work that you're interested in. Even whan you're not sharing it publically it will help you understad how to evaluate yourself in comparison with your past experience.

Arrange this feedback on the matrix following intent such as the advice, compliment, criticism and suggestion. What advice do you want to follow? Which criticisms prompt you to take action? Which suggestions can you ignore and which are meaningful?

## Set attainable goals

Set yourself an attainable goals and relates to the performance, and methods towards measuring long-term goals. If you can't make a decision, ask yourself what is holding you back or pushing you forward?

Learn to make a decisions quickly and intuitively without overthinking it. One method is to use the yes/no rule. For instance, when visiting the doctor with medical symptoms, the doctor uses the process of elimination with health related questions in diagnostics.

## Making decisions quick

In critical situations if you are not able to make a decision quickly follow this method to delegate the actions. Ask the following questions: Does this target pose a persistent and immediate thread? If the answer is yes, then ask- Are we the only ones that can deal with it or should make the decision? And the final question would be about the immediate imapact and consequences.

Another factor on making faster decisions is limiting the options to choose from. Because the more options you will juggle in your mind, the more dissatisfied you will be. Intuitively you might think that more variety will guarantee to make better decisions. but usually the opposite is true: the greater the choice, the higher our expectations- and the more we worry that we are going to make the worng choice, the most likely it will happen.

Test how this paradox reflects in the real world situations. Demonstrating example. In a supermarket salesperson offers a variety of jams for custopers to try: six varieties on one day, twenty-four varieties on another. With a smaller selection, 40 percent tried the jams and 30 percent bought it. The bigger selection attracted 60 percent of the people, but only 2 percent buys the jam.

The conclusion- choice is alluring, but with too many choices presented, it can be confusing. 

## Where is the niche?

Drawing a model helps you to identify the gaps in the market: position your business competitors according to the three axis (e.g. pricing, potential for the passing trade, popularity).

The goal of every new business is to identify and occupy the gap in the market. In areas that are dense with competitors, you should only enter the market if is a 'category killer'. Look for an area, the niche that has been overlooked and that is not occupied.

The task is not so much to see what everybody has seen, but to think what nobody has thought about that which everybody sees.

## The personal performance model

In a model on a scale from five to ten ask the following questions:

Heve to. To what extend my current tasks are imposed on or demanded of me?
Able to. To what extend do my tasks match my abilities?
Want to. To what extend do my current task correspond to what I really want?

After three weeks, analyze the shapes of the different 'sails'. If it moves, the jobs offer you variety.
If the shape of the sail is always the same, ask yourself following:

What do you want?
What are you able to do what you want?
What are you able to do?
Do you want what you are able to do?

If you can't do something, you have to work at it.

## Learn from your mistakes

Reflecting on your actions and learning from them sounds simple, but it's almost impossible. This theory is based on idea of a 'second-order' observation.

First-order observers see things how they appear to them. For them, the world is simply there, a quincidentially. Second-order observers, on the other hand, attribute what first-order observers see and how they see it. First-order observers are unaware of their own way of observing- it's their blind spot.  Recognizing this blind spot makes you a second-order observer. They are able to point out that it is possible to see things differently. 

In a single loop scenario something that works well is not changed but repeated. In the worst case practice the same mistake is repeated, or a problem is solved without answering a question how it arose in the first place.

In a double-loop learning, you think about what you do and try to break the pattern not by simply doing things differentlu, but by thinking why you are doing it in a such a way you used to, What are the objectives and values behind your actions? If you are fully aware of them, you may be able to change them,

The problem inherent in the double loop is the discripency between what we say we are about to do (known as 'espoused theory') and what we actually do (known as 'theory in use'). If we really want to change something, it isn't enough to create a guidelines to our employees and ourselves, or to give directives. These only reach us as a command. Real changes occur when we reassess our more deeply rooted reasons, objectives and values. These are the 'force fields' that affect the 'theory in use'.

When was the last time you broke a familiar pattern in your life and really did something differently? Which pattern would you like to break?  is preventing you from breaking it?

## The AI Model 

The AI stands for Appreciative Inquiry, a method that involves concentrating on our strengths, positive attributes and a potential of the company or a person rather than weaknesses. 'What is going really well at the moment?' replaces the classical question 'What is the problem?', which creates more positive outset and moves the attention away from the negative emotional balance.

The basic principle is to take an idea that is not yet fully developed and continue building it instead of prematurely abandoning it.

People often reveal their character in their approach to the discussions. Depending on their answers to suggestions, they fall into one of the four categories:
The faukt-finder: 'tHE IDEA IS GOOD, BUT...'
The dictator: No!
The teacher: 'No, the idea isn't good, because...'
An AI thinker: 'Yes, and we could also...'

Next time you are in a group discussion, make a note how wach person presents heir arguments. It can be from the scale of negative to positive and destructive to constructive.

To every conflict there are different types of reactions. Flight, fight or give up categorizes in emotional responses and may tell about the maturity of the individual by their approach to finding a resolution. Reaching a consensus, evade responsibly or offering a compromise is more rational reaction and is more important in understanding the both sides and aim towards resolution that are emotionally neutral and diplomatic.

## Why your experiences do not make you any wiser?

Why do we never expect unexpected events? Lebanese writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls this phenomenon - a black swan-- our inability to predict the future from the past. it is also why some superficial ideas taken from not calculated decisions takes a hold, while others bloom briefly before disappearing from the public eye.

Translating it into the graph, the development takes the form of a curve typical of the progress of an epidemic. It rises, gradually at first, then reaches the critical point of any newly launched product, when many products fail. The critical point for any innovation is the transition from the early adopters to the sceptics, for at this point there is a 'chasm'. According to the US sociologist Morton Grodzins, if the early adopters succeed in getting the innovation accross the chasm to the sceptical masses, the epidemic cycle reaches the tipping point. From there, the curve rises sharply when the market adaption has reached success point.

## Faith is in our knowledge

One thing is undisputed- the world around us becomes increasingly fast-paced and complex, the amount that we really know -- that we can rarely grasp and understand-- decreases. Today it is more or less taken for granted that we do not understand many of the things that surround us and that we use believing we know that it works, for instance, our smartphones. As a result, we tend to assign more importance to those who can actually explain something than to their actual explenation. It has become the norm to convince the people with images and emotions rather than with the arguments, because we are no longer able to understand increasingly complex explanations.

## Situational leadership

At any point of your career you are going to ask the following questions: do i have the right people for this project? The self-evaluation is more revealing than the question itself. A good team is the one that can critically judge its own capabilities. the real strength lies in difference, not in similarities, so how well do you know your team?

Equally important is to evaluate the environment if you are willing to accept style of leadership at situation at hand. These dynamics distinguishes between:

1. Instructing. when they start a job, employees need a strong leadership. When they are new their level of commitment is usually high, but the experience is still low. It takes time, guidance and instructions to understand the assignment and team's dynamic.
2. Coaching. The employees level of expertise has risen. They are asked questions and are looking they look for the answers themselves.
3. Supporting. Their levels of expertise has risen sharply. The level of motivation can vary: either it has fallen down (employees resign), or it has gone up as a result of given more independence (employees are encouraged to come up with their own ideas).
4. Delegating. Employees are fully in control of their work. The level of motivation is high. They are given their own projects and  lead their own teams.

Lead your employees in such a way that you yourself become superfluous. And lead your employees to be successful, so that one day they can be in leadership position themselves.

## How to turn a group into the team?

If you are leading or coordinating a team, you should present the team performance model at the beginning of every project. One of the performance models was developed by Allan Dexter, and it illustrates seven different stages tha tparticipants in a project typically go through. After the project has started, follow up to your team members regularly:
1. How far along are you? (at which stage of the project?)
2. What do you need to do move forward (to reach the next stage)?

If you are unsure about the work process, ask and write down the main keys that applies to each member individually and then summarize it as for the team. Groups move forward when one of its members takes the next step. As a leader, be prepared to be the first to make mistakes.
